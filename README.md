Blackjack
=========

This was our first game project in college (1st year, 2nd semester)!
The purpose was to learn more about C++ and to use object oriented programming for the first time.

The application does the following (due to professor guidelines):
- Ask how many players are in the game and their amount of money for the game
- Start a series of rounds of blackjack until only one player remains in game (the winner)
- At the beginning of a round each player is required to make a bet
- After the cards are shown, players must stand, hit or double

Making this game was a lot of fun and we learned tons of new stuff about C++,
it features cards drawn in the terminal (ascii style :p) which makes things a little more interesting

Just compile and run, game automatically creates a "players.txt" to keep track of the current game in progress (delete it to start a new game!)
